# Trend Micro CTF Asia Pacific & Japan 2015 Online Qualifier

To be honest, it was not a well-organized CTF. A lot of scaling problems, a lot of shameless Trend Micro placement (well, duh), categories and awarded points are too subjective, and some tasks can be solved just by guessing. Still, some interesting challenges.

Challenge board was down one second after the competition has ended, so I may not be correct in specifying challenge names, descriptions and attached files.
