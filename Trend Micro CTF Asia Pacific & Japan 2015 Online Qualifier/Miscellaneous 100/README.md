As it is the case with many Trend Micro challenges, this one involves a lot of guesswork, buzzword-bingo and learning about the way Trend Micro works. Solving it basically involves going through Trend Micro videos, press releases and blog entries, and some answers don't really make sense to me. Well, I guess it's kind of unfair to blame the company organizing CTF for product-placement, but come on, this was just weak.

I'll just list everything, here goes:
